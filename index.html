					<h3>LTA TAP Merit (2019)</h3>
					<p>Lead a team of 4 to create a project that sought to aid visually impaired to be better able to navigate their surroundings and traffic. <br></br>

<br></br>1. Used existing infrastructure to reduce materials and implementation costs. 
<br></br>2. Gathered meaningful data through interviews with target audience and ground-work
<br></br>3. Created computer models in blender to better understand the ergonomics and feasibility of protoypes 
<br></br>Competed with 9 other groups from various Junior Colleges, Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education

<br>I learned about how to ensure a high standard of product and checkpoints in place to ensure that the product is safe, feasible and easy to use for the target audience. </p>

					<h3>Colours's Award (2018)</h3>
					<p>I represented my school in National School Games (A divisions) for the years 2017,2018 and 2019. In the year 2018, we managed to clinch a spot in semi-finals for the year 2018 and were also awarded with Colours Award for sporting excellence in Football. This was a major event for me as the school was not well known for its football CCA prior to this. We learned from our mistakes from the previous season in 2017 where we placed 9th and started to change our strategy by focusing on playing around everyone's strengths and weaknesses. We had to put in extra effort to manage study and CCA by coming in early to train and training on weekends. This was especially taxing for me as I live in Sengkang and the school is in Bukit Batok. However, I tried my best to not fall behind in my studies by squeezing in time to study during 1.5 hr journey to and from school and then going for runs and tactical play before morning assembly. Subsequently, for the 2019 season we placed 5th as vast majority of our team belonged to the graduating batch who were focusing on their Alevels. </p>

					<h3>IBQ Participation (2018)</h3>
					<p>I was selected to represent my school in the International Biology Quiz held at Anglo Chinese Junior College. I could not achieve a desirable result as the year's topic (Geriatric Medicine) was relatively new to me. However, I still learned a lot about the following:<br></br>
					1. theories of ageing in evaluating anti-aging  interventions <br></br>
2. Understood physiological changes that accompany ageing To appreciate the challenges in conducting a geriatric assessment <br></br>
3. Understood common drug-related problems arising from age-related  physiological changes<br></br>
4. Understood the ethical principles and ethical theories in decision making during medical dilemmas <br></br>
5. Had a deeper look at Singapore’s ageing trend, and appreciate Singapore’s policies and action plans in preparation for an ageing population <br></br>
6. Formulated a comprehensive management plan for each syndrome <br></br>
7. Had an overview of pathophysiology, diagnosis, non-pharmacological management of major chronic diseases, common infections and the appropriate choices of medications for each disease.<br></br>
